As the vision of Palm Tree faded into the shimmering horizon, Katafa pointed silently across the lagoon. A canoe emerged from the southern beach, gliding smoothly toward them — the same one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Without a word, they stepped off the coral and made their way down to the warm, white sands of the inner beach to welcome the arrival.
Earlier, the sea had crashed violently behind them, yet in front of them, the lagoon’s infinite blue was so still it mirrored the sky like polished glass. Dick’s eyes were lost in that reflection — not just of the sea, but of his own uncertain past.
When little Tari, the son of the netmaker, asked, “Taori, who are you?” Dick hesitated. The boy’s innocence struck a nerve. Could he explain Marua, the shipwrecks, or the loneliness that shaped him?
“I am Taori, Tari,” he said gently. “Why do you ask?”
The boy, already distracted, shrugged and darted off to the others shouting about the net they were pulling ashore.
But that one question lingered in Dick’s mind like a windless sail, stirring memories. Of Katafa. Of Kearney. Of Palm Tree Island where danger still brewed.
Standing beside him, Katafa's dark hair caught the breeze like a banner, her eyes locked on the horizon. “Look,” she whispered.
Palm Tree’s shadow appeared again through the tropical mirage — ghostlike but real. And in it, they both saw their past…and possibly, their future.
