 # Automated Book Versioning and Retrieval

This project demonstrates how to store, semantically search, and rank multiple versions of book chapters using [ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) and a simple RL-style reward scoring system.

---

## Objective

Given a single chapter of a book in multiple stages:
- `raw` (original scrape)
- `writer` (AI-written version)
- `reviewer` (AI-reviewed version)
- `final` (human-edited version)

This project:
1. Stores each version in ChromaDB with metadata.
2. Allows **semantic search** across all versions using embeddings.
3. Ranks and returns the best version using a **reinforcement learningâ€“inspired reward function**.

##  Features

-  Supports 4 versions per chapter: `raw`, `writer`, `reviewer`, `final`
-  Semantic Search using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
-  Reinforcement Learning (RL) based scoring to suggest the best version
-  ChromaDB with DuckDB-backed persistence

---

##  Usage

### Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## How It Works

### Step 1: Add Versions to ChromaDB

```bash
python versioning/chroma_db.py

### Step 2:
'''bash
python versioning/rl_search.py
